# Cumberlan
A project started during SwampHacks V (Jan 2019).

A great portion of this code (to quantify what I mean by a great portion, its
perhaps about a good 95%) was taken from Tiger Sachse (https://github.com/tgsachse),
a computer science student at the University of Central Florida. This bot is
greatly inspired by his Lion bot, and it is serving me as a good entry into
programming Discord bots.

Huge thanks to you, Tiger Sachse.
